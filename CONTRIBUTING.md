## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use Ruff for both linting and formatting. The configuration can be found in `pyproject.toml`. To ensure your code meets our style guidelines:

1. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   pre-commit install
   ```

2. The pre-commit hooks will automatically:
   - Run the Ruff linter with auto-fixing enabled
   - Run the Ruff formatter
   - Check for common issues
